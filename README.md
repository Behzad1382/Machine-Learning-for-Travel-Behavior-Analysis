Work-From-Home Prediction during COVID-19
Overview
This repository contains code for predicting work-from-home behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic using cognitive characteristics and habits. The project aims to analyze various factors influencing individuals' tendencies to work from home and develop predictive models based on machine learning algorithms, particularly Decision Trees and Random Forests.

Decision Tree Classifier:
Performance Overview: The Decision Tree Classifier achieved an overall accuracy of approximately 68%, as measured on the test set.
Confusion Matrix: The confusion matrix reveals the classifier's performance across different classes. It shows that the model had varying degrees of success in correctly predicting each class. For instance, it performed well in predicting class 5 (indicating a strong tendency to work from home), achieving a high precision, recall, and F1-score.
Class Imbalance Impact: The model struggled more with minority classes (classes 1, 2, 3, and 4), as evidenced by lower precision, recall, and F1-scores for these classes. This suggests that the model might benefit from further techniques to address class imbalance.
Recommendations: To improve the Decision Tree Classifier's performance, potential strategies include feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and exploring alternative algorithms.
Random Forest Classifier (with SMOTE):
Performance Overview: The Random Forest Classifier, trained with SMOTE to address class imbalance, achieved an overall accuracy of approximately 63% on the test set.
Confusion Matrix: The confusion matrix illustrates the classifier's performance across different classes, revealing similar trends to the Decision Tree Classifier. However, the performance of the Random Forest Classifier appears slightly lower overall.
Impact of SMOTE: While SMOTE helped mitigate class imbalance, the performance improvement may not have been substantial. This suggests that other factors, such as feature quality or model complexity, could be influencing model performance.
Further Analysis: Additional investigation into feature importance, model complexity, and hyperparameter tuning could help identify areas for improvement.
Next Steps: Future iterations of the model could experiment with different resampling techniques, feature selection methods, or more advanced ensemble algorithms to potentially enhance predictive performance.
Overall Interpretation:
Both models show promise in predicting work-from-home behavior based on cognitive characteristics and habits, with the Decision Tree Classifier outperforming the Random Forest Classifier marginally.
However, there's room for improvement, particularly in addressing class imbalance and optimizing model parameters.
Further analysis and experimentation, including feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and potentially exploring more advanced algorithms, could lead to enhanced predictive performance and a more robust model for predicting work-from-home behavior during COVID-19.
